# Demystifying Jugalbandi: What Jugalbandi isn’t?

_<mark style="color:purple;">Jugalbandi leverages pre-trained models via RAG, extends beyond government schemes and chatbots, is platform-agnostic, requires customization, and offers free code but may contain some cost-bearing components.</mark>_

As Jugalbandi continues to evolve and expand its reach, we think it’s helpful to clarify some  common misconceptions to understand its true potential and capabilities better. Here are the key clarifications:

**Jugalbandi does not require training an AI model**

It's important to know that Jugalbandi doesn’t involve developing an AI model from scratch. Rather, it leverages pre-trained models such as GPT-4, Llama, Phi by integrating them into various applications. The accuracy offered by Jugalbandi is not due to the fine tuning of these models either, rather it relies on an approach called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that removes the need of training an AI model from scratch or fine tuning a model.&#x20;

**Jugalbandi application is not limited to government schemes**

While Jugalbandi’s first application was a bot built for seeking information on government schemes, its utility extends well beyond this realm. Its conversational and multilingual interaction capabilities make it suitable for diverse sectors.

**Jugalbandi is not confined to chatbot functionality on WhatsApp and Telegram**&#x20;

Jugalbandi is platform-agnostic, capable of integrating with a wide array of digital platforms, including mobile apps, web portals, and other messaging services. This flexibility ensures that Jugalbandi can meet users on their preferred platforms, providing consistent and accessible support across multiple channels.

**Jugalbandi is not a simple plug and play API**

Jugalbandi implementation goes beyond simple plug-and-play APIs that require zero to minimal coding for integration. While it offers robust functionalities and flexibility, integrating Jugalbandi into applications often involves tailoring and customization for specific usecases.

**Jugalbandi code is free to use**

If you wish to deploy Jugalbandi for your use case, the code is available freely on GitHub. One thing to note, however, is that all the components of the Jugalbandi stack are not entirely free of any cost. While many elements are open-source or low-cost, certain components like GPT models and cloud services may incur additional charges to be borne by the entrepreneurs building out their instance of Jugalbandi.
