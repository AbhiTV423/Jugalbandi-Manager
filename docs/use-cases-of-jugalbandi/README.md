# USE CASES OF JUGALBANDI

The selected use cases of Jugalbandi in this section illustrate its applications across various domains, including those at Proof of Concept (POC) and implementation stages. Collaborations on these span across national and international governments, civil society, and regulatory bodies. This section does not cover all the use cases. The intent behind covering specific use cases is two fold:

1. Jugalbandiâ€™s ability to ease access to justice. For instance, initial use cases like NHRC Bots, JIVA, Nyaya Setu, JAGRIT, and SEBI's Investor Knowledge Portal highlight its role in providing quick, verified, and contextualised information, including legal and regulatory details and scheme-related information. Beyond information provision, other use cases show how Jugalbandi supports grievance redressal by helping users structure grievances effectively and connect with relevant departments or dispute resolution services via open protocols like PULSE.

2. Highlight applications beyond justice-related functions, such as service provision for marginalised populations (e.g., Bandhu's housing use case) and addressing environmental justice and climate action (e.g., Wildlife First use case). These instances demonstrate Jugalbandi's flexibility and its ability to integrate with diverse services, such as using Bhashini for Indian languages in India-based use cases and Microsoft Azure for international applications, ensuring adaptability across operational needs.
