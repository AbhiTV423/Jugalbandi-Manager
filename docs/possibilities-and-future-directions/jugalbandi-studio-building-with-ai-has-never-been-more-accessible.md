# Jugalbandi Studio: Building with AI has never been more accessible

Technology around us is rapidly evolving, making the need for intuitive and user-friendly platforms more critical than ever. This is especially true for technology that has the potential to improve lives across various sectors by enhancing access to information and enabling action. Simplifying access to such technology for developers and functional experts is necessary to reduce dependence and roadblocks in development. This is the rationale that inspired the creation of Jugalbandi Studio.

Jugalbandi Studio is an intuitive and user-friendly application designed to simplify bot creation and implementation meant for users with minimal technical expertise. It features a chat-based interface where users can functionally articulate their bot requirements without worrying about the technical know-how.&#x20;

### How is Jugalbandi studio different from Jugalbandi manager?

Jugalbandi Studio is designed to make bot creation accessible to users with minimal technical expertise by offering an intuitive, chat-based interface and guided setup. It simplifies the process of defining bot requirements, customising functionalities, and visualising user journeys, enabling anyone to develop and deploy bots without deep technical knowledge. In contrast, Jugalbandi Manager acts as a managed service that caters to developers, providing a robust, scalable framework for building and managing sophisticated AI-powered bots. It supports multiple platforms and can integrate with any LLM or services, allowing for advanced customization and scalability suitable for larger user bases and more complex applications.

### Core Capabilities of Jugalbandi Studio

It has a user-friendly Interface

Jugalbandi Studio features an intuitive chat-based interface where users can describe their bot requirements in natural language.

For example, users can simply type, "I need a bot to help farmers find government schemes," and the Studio will guide them through the setup.

It allows customization

Jugalbandi Studio includes a tool for developing flow diagrams. These diagrams provide a visual representation of interaction paths, making it easier to structure the chatbot’s functionalities and user journeys. For instance, users can visualise how a farmer might interact with the bot to find relevant schemes and follow-up actions.
