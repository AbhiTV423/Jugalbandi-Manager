# IS JB APPLICABLE TO YOUR USE-CASE?

Jugalbandi is a versatile tool that can be applied to a wide array of scenarios as long as we think of it as an “information and action tool”. The term "action" is broad and encompasses a wide range of possibilities, so instead of narrowly defining what actions Jugalbandi can facilitate, we encourage you to consider the potential applications in your context. To assist you in evaluating whether Jugalbandi is a highly applicable solution for your needs or if it requires some modifications, or if another digital tool might serve you better, we have developed a thinking model. This model is designed to guide you through key questions to assess the direct applicability of Jugalbandi for your use case. By answering these questions, you can determine how well Jugalbandi aligns with your requirements and identify any adjustments that may be necessary.

Primary Questions - If your use case fits into any of these questions, its highly applicable for the adoption of the Jugalbandi stack

1. Provision of quick and verified information

Do your users usually need to search through large amounts of information? Is providing immediate, contextualized, and verified information a critical aspect of your service to the end user?&#x20;

2. &#x20;Multichannel Communication

Do you require a system that can also support multiple communication channels (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram, web apps, IVRS)?&#x20;

3. Multilingual Support

Is your organization looking to provide services or information in multiple languages? &#x20;

4. Action Support

Do you need to allow the users to take actions going beyond just provision of information, such as booking appointments, signing up for services, or initiating legal proceedings through a conversational interface?&#x20;

Secondary Questions - These are important considerations if the primary questions indicate that Jugalbandi is highly applicable. They help to further refine the understanding of how well the Jugalbandi stack can be implemented and tailored to specific needs, but the answers might not be immediately known or might require further assessment.

1. AI Infrastructure

Can your current IT setup handle AI operations, including data processing and storage? Do you have access to cloud computing platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure?

2. Data Privacy Compliance

Is the application of Jugalbandi in congruence with the data and privacy policies/regulations applicable to the organization?&#x20;
